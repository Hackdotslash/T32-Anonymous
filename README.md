# Let's Write 

Our world is enriched with a variety of people.Many of them are privileged to have all their senses working properly, while some have a slight disadvantage of not having some of their senses working  properly ,like people who could not speak.They constitute to be among the 5% people in the world.We don’t call them disabled, rather we call them as differently abled.The only way for them to communicate is either by writing or through digital typing .Certainly we have several technologies for them to communicate via typing.Some technologies like sign language to communicate with persons who are like them.However they lag behind when it comes to write.Education is incomplete without one holding a pen and paper.However it is not possible for every such differently abled person to reach to teachers in classroom mode, especially for ones who reside in rural areas and who are financially very weak to hire personal teachers for aid.The situation has become worse in pandemic.

What we are trying to do in our solution is ,we will be creating an online board where mute person will be able to connect to a mentor on a video call. Both will be equipped with a mobile phone, pen and paper. Mentor will start making some sort of symbols like alphabets,numbers and basic stuffs for a new comer,a snapshot will be taken and the letter or symbol he has drawn will get binarized and come on the screen with a transparent background, then the impaired person  will imitate the same sign /alphabet ,click a snapshot .By this both mentor’s and mute person’s symbols will come on the screen in parallel.Both the mentor and student can compare what each one of them has written, and how different they are.This way mentor will be able to guide the person at what point he has missed , and the person without speaking will communicate through his drawings.
